# lycheeCS (v0.6)

Forked from lycheeJS v0.6, lycheeCS is a CoffeeScript conversion of a useful
subset of the lycheeJS game library.

Left is a CoffeeScript (and JavaScript) game library for creating games in
modern web browsers. All supporting code for other platforms such as node.js and
v8gl is skipped, as is some math libs and other non-core components, as well as
boilerplate games and demos.

# Examples and Game Boilerplate

There is the [Game Boilerplate](http://martens.ms/lycheeJS/game/boilerplate)
and the [Jewelz Game](http://martens.ms/lycheeJS/game/jewelz) from lycheeJS to examine.

[The example source codes are all available at the lycheeJS github repository](https://github.com/martensms/lycheeJS/tree/master/game).


# Documentation

The documentation for lycheeJS is available in on the web at
[http://martens.ms/lycheeJS](http://martens.ms/lycheeJS) or at the [lycheeJS-
docs github repository](https://github.com/martensms/lycheeJS-docs).

No separate documentation is planned for lycheeCS at the moment, but the
functionaliy is mostly the same as in lycheeJS.

Keep this in mind though: In lycheeJS there are a lot of methods and properties
with a `__` prefix, and sometimes even `___`. These were shortened for my
sanity's sake.
